### <u> Things to consider</u>
* In order to run rspec, you'll need to comment out the following code:
1. comment out the following in the night_reader.rb file:
    ```
    night_reader = NightReader.new
    night_reader.call
    ```
2. comment out the following in the night_writer.rb file:
    ```
    night_writer = NightWriter.new
    night_writer.call
    ```


### <u> Future Goals for Project</u>
With more time, I'd love to build out code for capitalized letters, more puncuation and eventually translating Spanish letters to braille.
